# Heart Failure Clinical Record Analysis Using Data Science Techniques

- Selected the **Heart Failure Clinical Record** dataset, containing 13 attributes and 299 instances, with the target variable as `DEATH_EVENT`.
- Conducted **data preparation and cleaning**, including:
  - Identified no missing values.
  - Removed inconsistencies (e.g., decimal points in the `age` column).
- Performed **data exploration**:
  - Analyzed each attribute using descriptive statistics and visualized key relationships through graphs.
  - Explored significant relationships between attributes like ejection fraction, serum creatinine, and death events.
- Implemented **data modeling** with classification techniques:
  - Built and evaluated a **Decision Tree** model with varying depths, achieving the best accuracy of **73.33%**.
  - Designed a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** model, achieving an accuracy of **56.67%**.
  - Compared models and determined the **Decision Tree** as the better performer.
- Created confusion matrices for both models to analyze prediction results.
